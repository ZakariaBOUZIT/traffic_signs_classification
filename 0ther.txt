import os --->un module  fournit par Python dont le but d’interagir avec le système d’exploitation.


myList = os.listdir(path) --->Python method listdir() returns a list containing the names of the entries in the directory given by path.
The list is in arbitrary order. It does not include the special entries '.' and '..' even if they are present in the directory.


img = cv2.equalizeHist(img) ---> Consider an image whose pixel values are confined to some specific range of values only.
For eg, brighter image will have all pixels confined to high values. But a good image will have pixels from all regions of the image.
So you need to stretch this histogram to either ends (as given in below image, from wikipedia)
and that is what Histogram Equalization does (in simple words). ***This normally improves the contrast of the image***.



X_train = np.array(list(map(preprocessing, X_train)))--->  # TO IRETATE AND PREPROCESS ALL IMAGES


img = np.asarray(imgOrignal) --->numpy. asarray() function is used when we want to convert input to an array.
Input can be lists, lists of tuples, tuples, tuples of tuples, tuples of lists and ndarrays.
